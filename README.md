improving-deep-neural-networks
==============================

This repo contains code I wrote to learn more about Deep Neural Networks. The
code in here was written when I was studying the following topics:
hyperparameter tuning, regularization and optimization, etc. To complete an
on-line course on these subjects, I had to finish 5 programming assignments.
The Jupyter notebooks with the corresponding solutions are listed below:

* [Initialization](x)
* [Regularization](x)
* [Gradient Checking](x)
* [Optimization](x)
* [TensorFlow](x)
